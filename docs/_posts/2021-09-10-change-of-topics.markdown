Hello Again!

This week I started by compiling related academic research. I had originally wanted to study Video Games and Education Sociology, but upon starting my research I discovered 
that not only was it a very broad field, but there was a lot of research already being done in this field and I was most likely to reinvent the wheel. I began looking for new
topics to research and stumbled upon Video Game Analytics, more specifically Heat Maps. I remembered learning about Heat Maps in EECS 494 briefly and they were very fascinating.
My idea for my study is to develop a game that can create heat maps of player movements and then have the game evolve around these player movements. For example, if there is an 
area of the game map the player rarely visits, the game would move an npc there that the player is encouraged to interact with in order to get the player to explore new areas of 
the map.
