The people that stand to benefit the most from my results. I believe anyone that works in Game Development could benefit from my results, but more specifically game developers
developing open-world style games.This is because many of these types of games have large maps that players are not seeing the entirity of. Game Developers typically tend to work
for companies that specialize in Video Game Development and have many responsibilites. These responsibilites can range from character design, level design, and animations to play 
testing and coding the game engine. It is important to many Game Developers that their work is impactful. When you spend a large amount of time developing a fun side quest, or a 
cool sight to see you want players to discover it. My project will show how a game can detect where players are traveling and help push them to explore some of these extra 
locations. Game Developers often times have analytical data at their disposal and have ways of sending updates to correct player behavior if they don't like what their analytics
are telling them.
