I started this week by implementing a crouching feature. This way the player will be encouraged to crouch and camp a little more. You can crouch by pressing in the Z key, though I will be adjusting the key bindings this next week.

<br>Following that I put some time into fixing some bugs relating to how the AI was spawning and then converted the game from an infection style game to a 10 v 10 team deathmatch game, similar to that of Star Wars Battlefront. Each team gets 30 lives and once they are used up the game ends. I may up this to 50(+) in a later build after doing more playtesting.

<br>I also implemented the shotgun weapon, and designed it so it shoots multiple bullets at once, each doing a small amount of damage.

<br>Lastly this week I focused on adding new items to the map to make it feel more full. I added trash bins, mailboxes, newspaper signs, and spread more cars around the map and it definitely helps. I may continue to look for more "city" assets in the future to add but will need to playtest more first.

<br>You can download the new builds [here for Windows](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13pRgy9F9Xfb-oB9Uu-z3E3Old-9Xgua9/view?usp=sharing) or [here for Mac](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TAvSCTm6FkSO175fh442eiXxcZrlAoiL/view?usp=sharing). Pressing the O key closes the application still, but there is a quit button on the start and end screens. The tractor beam activates after 5 kills in the same spot now as this felt pretty balanced, but once again after playtesting more with new people I may adjust this number. Next week I will be fixing the key bindings, playtesting and getting the opinions of others, and implementing some form of dynamic feature that adjusts gameplay based on team lives left compared to other teams.
