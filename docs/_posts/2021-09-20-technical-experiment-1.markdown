This week I started my Technical Work in Unity. I started on Wednesday 9/15/21 and put about 2 hours that day into the basic movement controls and map design. From there I spent about 4 hours Thursday and Friday gathering models, basic animations, and developing the weapon. I wanted to test whether or not a game that evolves around player analytics is possible. I put 4 hours into the project on Saturday making a player that has a sniper rifle with the goal of making it so when the player shoots at an enemy or "kills" them the game records that data. If the game finds that a target is constantly being killed from a "camper" or in the same spot, the map would adjust to protect said players better and deter camping and keep the game changing. Sunday/Monday I put roughly 1 hour in, I wanted to see what it would be like to have analytics openly available to a player in real time by pressing a key. I implemented one form of analytic data (where players were killed from). Next week I want to look into implementing a multiplayer mode across 2 devices so I can test these implementations with real players and see their reactions. Additionally I want to work on the game map to make it feel more like an FPS game. Additionally I want to find more analytics that I can use to alter the game as it goes on. I feel making changes based on type of weapons would be one analytic that could be benefitial to monitor and will test this as well.
