I started this week by adjusting the key bindings. Movement is controlled by WASD, Sprint is controlled by Left Shift, Crouch is controlled by Left Control, and the weapons are toggled with numbers now instead of being a queue you clicked through. Additionally I added graphics for each weapon and the flare.

<br>Next I attempted to do some playtesting while I was home for break but for some reason my Mac continues to freeze whenever I attempt to run the game on it. I attempted removing assets from the game, but no matter what I did I couldn't get even the loading scene to work. I later uploaded the Unity project to my Mac from my Windows computer and attempted to run the game through the Unity Editor and it worked perfectly there. This leads me to believe that something is happening to the build that is breaking it. Due to this I do not have a Mac build for this weeks iteration. I did create this image for my itch.io page though.

<br>You can download the new build [here for Windows](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16jHXttYkoZCeCSVQYk3oORlqQuzRS1rT/view?usp=sharing). This week I plan to edit the win screen, adjust the death time and transition to the win screen, add audio, indicator to show where attack coming from, adjust UI to show lives left, adjust the appearance of the map to be more appealing, tweak the AI to notice the enemies nearest to them (or  enemies that are attacking them), and reduce the number of kills for the tractor beam. Lastly I need to work on my presentation for the showcase and create an Itch.io page.
