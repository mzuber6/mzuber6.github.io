In this post I will be disclosing the market research I have looked into this week. To start I looked into which market sector my research falls into.

I feel my research falls into the Entertainment sector, with 110,313 establishments in the US and over 1.8 million paid employees. There was over 141 billion dollars of sales, receipts, or shipments in 2002.

The biggest player in the entertainment sector as of September 2020 is Comcast Corp., with an annual revenue of 105.6 billion USD. A couple other big players are:
    
    - The Walt Disney Co. revenue equalling 69.7 Billion USD
    - Nintendo revenue equalling 13.8 Billion USD
    - Activision Blizzard revenue equalling 8.09 Billion USD
    - Roblox Corp revenue equalling 924 Million USD

- Comcast's primary business is broadcasting and cable television, along with internet service, and telephone service. 
- The Walt Disney Companies primary business is Media and Entertainment Distribution.
- Nintendo primarily works in developing video games and consoles
- Activision Blizzard's primary business is in creating interactive gaming and entertainment experiences.
- Roblox's primary business is to build a platform that enables shared experiences among billions of users.


Relevant Products to my Research Field:
- Skyrim is a relevant product to this research field. The game feature an open-world map that allows the player to roam the world and do as they please. My research could benefit by helping the game draw players towards areas of the map that are unexplored.
- The Assassins creed games could be benefited from my research as well as these are other games that have a very large map that could benefit from pushing players out into other areas.
- Fallout 4 is a third product that could benefit from my research. In this game you have settlements that you can develop, but whenever I play I really only develop 3 of my many settlements. Fallout 4 could benefit from my research by having technology that gets players to visit their other settlements more often.
- Minecraft is a product that has somewhat addressed this problem. In Minecraft as you spend time in a region the Difficulty will rise during the 3rd to 63rd in-game day. This means that in areas that players are in more often, the difficulty is higher. This can cause players to venture out to new unexplored areas but is not as direct as the methods I plan to use.
- Diablo is another product that addresses the problem of players not exploring the map, but doesn't encourage revisiting areas. My research would benefit the game as it would draw players back to the areas over time, and not just once to clear the fog.
