This week I met with Apoorva Bansal from Sucker Punch Productions. To begin I asked what kind of analytics he has looked into when developing his games. A few he mentioned that Nathan Hanish hadn't mentioned a couple weeks ago were when players were upgrading/acquiring items, sentiment of players through interviews, and the amount of time it takes for a player to complete a level. He recommended when looking at analytic data to have a hypothesis and metrics you want to better understand. 

Apoorva gave me a few tips when it comes to a dynamic game. To begin he said that the camping towers may be more of a sledgehammer approach and I may want to assess whether there is a better level design approach to the problem. Additionally, he mentioned that players may feel penalized and feel the game is not balanced if they are being punished for camping but only have one life while the other team has infinite lives. He mentioned collectables would be a good thing to adjust based on analytics.

Taking these comments into thought I decided to make it so the towers that spawn when you camp disappear after a short amount of time. This way the player is encouraged to move initially as they are exposed, but then the map resets so players can return to the spot if they would like after some time. I feel this is balanced because being lifted into the air does not guarantee your death, just makes you an easier target. Players could theoretically camp on top of towers still so I feel the penalization is not too strong.

<br>This week I did not do much technical work. I implemented the towers as mentioned above and then added in cars around the map to provide locations for players to camp as previously there would be no places for players to camp.
