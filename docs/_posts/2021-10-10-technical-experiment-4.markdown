This week I wanted to start off by figuring out what kind of game I wanted to do. I wanted to do a multiplayer fps game, but with the issues I was having with Photon, I needed a solution. I decided that I was still going to design a multiplayer game, but in place of players implement AI enemies to fight. This week I also need to develop a map, as the current map is just an open field and is not very fitting for this theme. Lastly, I wanted to start implementing the 3 new analytics from last week. If I have time I also wanted to implement a couple new weapons.

I started by working on the map, as without it I will have a harder time testing the enemy AI. I implemented NavMesh Obstacle spawning so that when the terrain rises and falls the enemy recognizes the new hills.
