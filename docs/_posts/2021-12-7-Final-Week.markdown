This week I cleaned up the win screen and added a little transition when the player dies/the game ends.

<br>Next I added a red Vignette to the camera to indicate the player is taking damage when being shot at

<br>I then added the team lives counter to the main UI. I tweaked the map to be a large pillar instead of just a floating slab, adjusted the AI to better notice closer enemies, though it does still lock on to certain players sometimes (but so do real players sometimes so this is okay), and lastly I adjusted the tractor beam to go after 3 kills.
<br>You can download the new build [here for Windows](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jkasFRkHWlipxCohJl3m4ESPoIZ5SksC/view?usp=sharing). This week I plan to do some playtesting to flush out any bugs before the showcase Friday and then I'm hoping for a successful showcase on Friday.
