This week I continued my technical work in Unity. I spent a majority of my time this week (12 hours) setting up Photon and getting a multiplayer build to work. I was having some issues with keeping everything syncronized. I did manage to get the players and enemies to syncronize, but the pause menu would not syncronize which was an issue. Unfortunately on Monday night when I opened Unity to take some pictures I accidentally clicked the update button on Unity and in the process of trying to fix the compilation errors I updated my PUN, not realizing this would overwrite any files I edited and change them back to their original state. Currently my project is not working as I need to change all of those files and did not have enough time before meeting on Tuesday. Additionally, I spent about 1 hour creating a new map. I want to work more on this map next week and make it feel more like a town, with buildings and structures that also morph from the ground. Attached is a gif showing the world as it always changes. The mounds that rise and fall are also the same ones that rise when a camper is detected, execept the wall will not drop in that instance. Next week I would like to start by fixing Photon, hopefully in 2 hours. Then I would like to add more to the current map to make it feel more futuristic. I want to add in a new type of weapon and adjust the analytics to use this new weapon in some different way. I also want to research different analytics I could use in the game, such as do players prefer higher ground or lower ground and forcing players to change scenary. I have an interview with Nathan Hanish of Stardock this week and I am excited to ask him questions and get his opinion on this topic as well.

Hours this week;
<br>Thursday: I spent about an hour making a new map and adjusting how the map reacts to campers
<br>Friday: I spent 4 hours working throught the [Photon Getting Started Tutorial](https://doc.photonengine.com/en-us/pun/current/demos-and-tutorials/pun-basics-tutorial/intro)
<br>Saturday: I spent roughly 2 hours finishing the tutorial from Friday
<br>Sunday: I put 6 hours into implementing different Photon components into my game. I syncronized many different components. I spent a lot of time troubleshooting components that weren't showing up across multiple builds.
<br>Monday: Went to take photos and videos and accidentally broke Photon
